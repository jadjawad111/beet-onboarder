## Change "Rubric's Creation" to "Rubrics Creation"

A simple text update across all files where this label appears.

### Files to Update

| File | Line | Current Text | New Text |
|------|------|--------------|----------|
| `src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx` | 48 | `"Rubric's Creation"` | `"Rubrics Creation"` |
| `src/pages/education/EducationIndex.tsx` | 19 | `"Rubric's Creation"` | `"Rubrics Creation"` |
| `src/pages/education/rubrics/RubricsIndex.tsx` | 134 | `Rubric's Creation` | `Rubrics Creation` |
| `src/components/Breadcrumbs.tsx` | 17 | `"Rubric's Creation"` | `"Rubrics Creation"` |

| `src/pages/education/ModulePage.tsx` | 10 | `"Rubric's Creation"` | `"Rubrics Creation"` |

### Additional Fix
In `EducationIndex.tsx` line 20, there's also a description that says "creating Rubric's tasks" which should be updated to "creating Rubrics tasks" for consistency.
